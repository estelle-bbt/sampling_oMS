<h1>What is the best proxy for observational mating success?</h1>
<p>We have conducted an experiment in which we surveyed each pollinator one by one along the visit sequences, up to the flower scale. By making assumptions about the carry-over (i.e., the number of successive flower visits during which pollen export remains effective), we are able to estimate the number of observational sexual partners, both for the female and the male function. We assume that the carry-over is about 10, based on a previous study on the sister species <em>Brassica napus</em>: for the male function, 91% of the seeds were sired in the first four flowers visited after a focal individual, and no seeds were sired after the 14th flower visited <span class="citation" data-cites="cresswell_method_1994">[<a href="#ref-cresswell_method_1994" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Now, we imagine a more common experiment <em>in natura</em> in which we cannot follow the pollinators one by one. We could rather observe plant by plant. We then have the following data :</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of arrivals (female function) / departures (male function) per individual, which are highly correlated = number of contacts (which may be independent or not) per individual<br>
</li>
<li>the total number of visits per individual<br>
</li>
<li>the total visit duration per individual (but not useful here, as we only formulate hypotheses about visit sequences, without getting interested in the number of pollen grains exported/deposited): we leave that aside</li>
</ul>
<p>We can imagine that each observer notes the time of the pollinator’s arrival on each plant (start), to order events of contacts:</p>

<p>But then, what to do with this? We don’t know the identity of the pollinator,<br>
so it is difficult to infer anything from the visit order…</p>
<p>Something more realistic is to start from data at the individual level without inferring anything about the effect of visit order:</p>

<p>To discuss: something smart to do with contact order?</p>
<p>Then, we can summarize data at the scale of the observation session. At least useful to compare<br>
populations between them? We can get the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of contacts with id</li>
<li>Total number of visits<br>
</li>
<li>Total number of visited individuals (maximum oms)<br>
</li>
<li>Total number of pollinators (but see below)<br>
</li>
<li>Total visit duration (but again, we leave that aside)</li>

<p>Because, imagine that one individual had a lot of contacts with pollinators, but<br>
that only a few other individuals were visited: this should weaken the link between<br>
the number of contacts per id and oms.</p>
<p>Using the data table with contacts ordered by time, we could imagine estimating<br>
the diversity of potential sexual partners according to their relative frequency<br>
(e.g., using Hill/Shannon/Simpson indices).</p>
<p>NB: In our experiment, we know for sure the number of pollinators that visited<br>
plants. <em>In natura</em>, it would be much more difficult, but we could at least get an estimation<br>
based on the species diversity that we observed (i.e., if we observed<br>
two contacts by <em>Bombus</em> and one contact by <em>Apis</em>, there are at least two different<br>
pollinators).</p>
<p>We now investigate which proxy best correlates with the observational number of mates.<br>
We estimate the latter using a carry-over of 10, as well as 5 and 20. We thus<br>
have two main proxies:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>the number of contacts per individual<br>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="A">
<li>the total number of visits per individual</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ol type="A">
<li>For the number of contacts per individual, we can explore its correlation with<br>
oms using:<br>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>index_A1: the raw number of contacts per individual<br>
</li>
<li>index_A2: relativized by the total number of contacts in the session<br>
</li>
<li>index_A3: multiplied by the total number of potential sexual partners<br>
</li>
<li>index_A4: combining index_A2 and index_A3<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li>For the total number of visits per individual:<br>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>index_B1: the raw number of visits per individual<br>
</li>
<li>index_B2: relativized by the total number of visits in the session<br>
</li>
<li>index_B3: multiplied by the total number of potential sexual partners<br>
</li>
<li>index_B4: combining index_B2 and index_B3<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After discussion with Jeanne, we also explore the same proxies based on total visit duration per individual:<br>
</p>
<ol start="3" type="A">
<li>For the total visit duration per individual:<br>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>index_C1: the raw total visit duration per individual<br>
</li>
<li>index_C2: relativized by the total visit duration in the session<br>
</li>
<li>index_C3: multiplied by the total number of potential sexual partners<br>

<li>index_C4: combining index_C2 and index_C3<br>

<h1>Which traits are under sexual selection?</h1>
<p>We measured:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>nb_flo:</strong> the number of “receptive” flowers</p></li>
<li><p><strong>nb_flo_open:</strong> the number of opened flowers (including very new ones)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>nb_stem:</strong> the number of stems</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Best way to do this analysis: SEM for the direct and indirect effect on oms and rs?</p>
<p>We proceed per sex and per treatment, as we saw that (i) there is an effect of ttt at least on oms and (ii) rs is different (contrary to oms) between sexual function, and there are biological hypotheses on a different effect of floral traits between sexual function.</p>

<p>For males, we estimate the paternity share by excluding selfing in order to be consistant with oms. Paternity share is the proportion of genotyped seeds sired by a focal father. We can also do the analysis by integrating selfing events in the estimation of paternity share (mean_ps_all).</p>
<p>For females, post-poll process are more difficult to define: the diversity of sexual partners that had reached ovules matter (?) but here we define post-poll as the partner ability to fertilize ovules (“from the female point of view, to which point she has gathered a good team which score a lot of points”) but note that we did not categorize this as as post-poll process in the abundance paper )</p>
