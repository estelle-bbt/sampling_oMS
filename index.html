<p>WARNING !!!!!!!!! oms (both at the flower or the id scale) is encoded as following: if it has not been visited at all (i.e.&nbsp;oms including itself = 0), then oms = NA. Otherwise, oms is a true zero because it can reproduce through selfing. BUT this is valuable only when reproductive success include selfing (as in the first manuscript, to keep consistancy); if we focus on outcrossed reproductive success, then null oms should not exist.</p>

<h1>Path analysis with oms</h1>
<p>We measured:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>nb_flo:</strong> the number of “receptive” flowers</p></li>
<li><p><strong>nb_flo_open:</strong> the number of opened flowers (including very new ones)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>nb_flo_all:</strong> the total number of flowers (including very new and old ones)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>height_max:</strong> the height of the highest flower</p></li>
<li><p><strong>height_mean:</strong> the mean height of the highest flowers on each stem</p></li>
<li><p><strong>nb_stem:</strong> the number of stems</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Best way to do this analysis: SEM for the direct and indirect effect on oms and rs?</p>
<p>We proceed per sex and per treatment, as we saw that (i) there is an effect of ttt at least on oms and (ii) rs is different (contrary to oms) between sexual function, and there are biological hypotheses on a different effect of floral traits between sexual function.</p>

<h1>Path analysis with oms and post-poll process</h1>
<p>For males, we estimate the paternity share by excluding selfing in order to be consistant with oms. Paternity share is the proportion of genotyped seeds sired by a focal father. We can also do the analysis by integrating selfing events in the estimation of paternity share (mean_ps_all).</p>
<p>For females, post-poll process are more difficult to define: the diversity of sexual partners that had reached ovules matter (?) but here we define post-poll as the partner ability to fertilize ovules (“from the female point of view, to which point she has gathered a good team which score a lot of points”) but note that we did not categorize this as as post-poll process in the abundance paper )</p>
